## Want to automate your tests but you are not a developer or don't have knowledge of selenium and languages supported by it like java??? If yes then this is the tool you are looking for. ##

This tool provides simple user interfaces to configure and automate tests. This tool uses **selenium** to run the configured tests.
Main objective of this tool is to make users able to harness full potential of selenium without any need to have knowledge of java or selenium. If you have knowledge of JavaScript / JQuery / HTML then itâ€™s a plus and using this tool will be a piece of cake. Just download excel supported by the tool (web tool will be added soon), configure tests in it (it's very simple), Save excel and run tool

_To see how **easy** it is to use this tool and to see this tool in action **[Download](Downloads.md)** it, Extract zip and **run bundled example test case** through tool's BAT file (windows) or JAR (linux)._ **(Visit [Running Tool](RunningTool.md) for more information**)

Visit [Excel File Configuration](ExcelFileConfiguration.md) for details on how to configure this tool and information on Example test case which is bundled with this tool.

## Who should use this tool ##
  1. ### Quality Assurance ###
    * Automate tests without going in to technical details.
    * Easy to automate, run and share.
    * Automate tests. It saves your time and caches regression issues.
    * You can also take help of developers to create automation test sheet for the functionality they developed and to get customization in the tool. Customization can be plugged in to future releases of the tool and wont be lost.
  1. ### Developers ###
    * Encourages Test Driven Development
    * Create your own action commands in java and registering them with tool's runtime.
    * Actions commands created by you can utilize selenium or may use totally different java API to perform a task (such as - use Java Mail API to perform an operation on a mail box)
    * **Power of REUSE.** On the place of developing your own code for automation, we recommend using this tool. Customize the tool if required. Get rid of writing same code again and again. Once you developed an action command then any person (say a QA team member) can use it for further automation and you will never ever have to write a similar code again for any other test case.



**Features of the tool:-**
  1. Simple to use. Download, Add test data, provide preferred browser and run tests.
  1. Its extendable and developers with knowledge of Java and selenium can develop more commands and add to this tool. Developers can use other tools of simple java code to create commands and integrate with the tool (For example. write a command to delete / mark read a mail in mailbox using Java Mail API and integrate with tool)
  1. Automate clicks, mouse hovers, sliders and many other events supported by selenium.
  1. Automate cases whete you need to switch between multiple browser windows / tabs.
